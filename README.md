## Features

Actually! Jimmy is a multipurpose open source Discord bot written in C using
[Concord](https://github.com/Cogmasters/concord) made mainly by TheMonHub noticeably used in r/furryteens discord
server.

- Moderation
    - Setting the Rules and sending it neatly into the channel like `#rules` for an example
    - Banning a member with an appeal system
    - Unbanning a member
    - Kicking a member
    - Timing out a member
    - Warning a member
    - The main point being that instead of having to type in reasons of the punishment/warning, instead Jimmy uses rule
      number for more consistent and predictable punishment/warning
    - Sending a DM to the target to inform about their punishment/warning
- Logging
    - Logging message changes including the medias
    - Logging nickname and profile picture changes
    - Logging join and leave
    - Logging moderation action such as ban, unban, kick, timeout, warn that are made through Jimmy
- Fun
    - Coin flip!
    - Dice rolling!
    - D20 fight!
    - Sending random cats/dogs/foxes pictures!
    - Getting profile picture of a member!
    - See how many message did a member send and automatically give role once they meet a certain requirement!
    - And more!
